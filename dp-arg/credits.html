<!-- beginning authors note -->
<span>
Please leave creator's style on! once again, this is a fic that invites and requires reader participation to proceed! <br>
You won't be required to type things, but you will be doing a LOT of clicking. Anything that you think you can click? Click it. Tap it. hover. Try everything.<br>
Because of the nature of this fic (and the end notes), the comments and end notes will be locked until you can get to any 1 of the 3 endings. <br>
If there's anything confusing in this fic, or bugs, PLEASE let me know.<br>
Mobile readers: remember to check the notebook for hints, and to reach an ending. <br>
</span>
<br><br><br><br><br>

<!-- credits / end notes for each css / img used -->
<span>There are 3 endings total (2 regular endings and 1 secret ending) -- can you get them all? 
    <a href="">Click here</a> to play again and try for any of the other endings!
</span> <br> <span>
While the narrative only requires you to visit any 5 apps before making you choose an ending, 
there are 16 total apps you can visit! Please check them all out!

    I obviously didn't make all the html mocks for them, so here are the credits:</span> <br>

<span>of course, a thank you to <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/jihnari/pseuds/jihnari">jihnari</a> and <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/the_grand_king_queen/pseuds/the_grand_king_queen">the_grand_king_queen</a> on discord for being my ux guinea pigs and testing out a bunch stuff for me on devices that I don't own! <br>
(join <a href="https://discord.gg/RzCqZNrfjg">said discord</a> if you want to scream with me about coding and html nonsense)</span>

<span>This was </span>
<ol>
<li>an excuse to use as many ao3 skins as possible in 1 work -- a bunch that I saw and wished I could use but hadn't yet, a bunch that I wanted to reuse/make, etc</li>
<li>partially inspired by outsider POV stories and "Danny has been kidnapped!" oneshots from phic phight 2021</li>
<li>an experiment in story telling, with the whole 2nd person thing</li>
<li>an attempt to out do myself after my last html fic with something even crazier </li>
</ol>

<span>If there are werid bugs / display issues / things that don't make sense, please let me know! <br>
(It helps if you give me screenshots with your device OS, model, and <a href="http://whatismyscreenresolution.net/">screen resolution</a> -- which you can comment here or on <a href="https://discord.gg/RzCqZNrfjg">discord</a>)<br><br>

Anyway, for the morbidly curious, I have dumped all this code on github (readme still pending...) if you want to see how it was put together. <br>
And lastly, thank YOU (yes you) for reading and making it this far!</span>
